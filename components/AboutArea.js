                Mission is a people's movement for water conservation started by
                Dr Ujjwalkumar Chavhan (IRS) in 2017 from Dhamangaon village in
                Chalisgaon tehsil in Jalgaon District of Maharashtra to address
                the problem of drought and floods, which was adversely affecting
                the livelihood of the farmers. It is a community-based,
                decentralized model of water conservation where the villagers
                come together to resolve problems of drought and flood.
