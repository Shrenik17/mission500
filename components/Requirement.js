              <b>Village selection</b> involves two distinct methods:
              <br />
              <b>1. Direct Selection by Paach Patil:</b>
              <br />
              The Paach Patil employs this method when identifying villages
              facing drought or water scarcity. The direct assessment of the
              prevailing conditions guides the selection process, allowing for
              immediate attention to areas in need.
              <br />
              <b>2. Community-driven Selection: </b>
              <br />
              In this approach, residents from regions susceptible to drought
              actively engage with The Paach Patil. Following a thorough
              evaluation of the villagers' commitment and dedication, The Paach
              Patil then makes informed decisions regarding the selection of
              villages. This collaborative process ensures that the chosen
              villages are not only in need but also possess a community-driven
              spirit for effective intervention.
